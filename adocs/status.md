# Status

Convenience view, rewritten by hand at the end of any turn that changed plan
state. The filesystem beats this file: on disagreement, `plan_current/` wins
and this file is rewritten to match it.

Updated: 2026-10-29, by Claude (docs tidied before the Linux run)

- Last done: S019  copy several cards at once, one thread per card
- In progress: none
- Next: S025  first run on Linux (the user, with a drive and SD cards)
- Blocked: S017 (Mac hardware checks) waits for the user (DEC-029)
- Parked:
  - Decisions the agents picked that the user has not confirmed yet:
    DEC-005 (folder date = earliest new file), DEC-026 to DEC-028,
    DEC-030 to DEC-032, DEC-034, DEC-035 (1)-(3), DEC-036 to DEC-040.
    Each says "not yet confirmed by the user" in decisions.md.
  - After S025: re-run the full adversarial audit, then plan the GUI.
  - The camera's PTP mode (USB without card-reader mode) is unsupported
    (DEC-004). Revisit if card-reader mode proves unreliable.
  - The permission-based tests assume a non-root user: run as root (e.g.
    Docker CI), most fail loudly, and `only_name_and_size_candidates_are_hashed`
    can pass falsely.
  - Linux exFAT: `canonicalize` keeps the case it is given, so two library
    spellings that differ only in case get two fallback locks (S013 fast
    check). Fold the case or key by inode there; check in S025.
  - A freshly formatted card without `DCIM` looks like any USB drive and is
    offered as a destination (S007 fast check). Telling them apart needs
    DiskArbitration (Mac) or udev (Linux).
  - `copy_plan` (public, one plan) still copies on one thread; only
    `Session` copies cards at once (DEC-040 (9)). A GUI must use `Session`.
  - macOS's disk-image service hung once on a test image (2026-10-28); the
    script now also detaches images attached but not mounted.
