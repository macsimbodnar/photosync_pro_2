# Decisions

Ids stable, never reused, newest entry last, index on top. Entries hold
current reasoning and may be compacted or superseded by rewrite — git keeps
every earlier version. Record a decision before or alongside the change it
covers, never after. Decisions belong to the user; agents propose.

Entry format:

```
## DEC-001  YYYY-MM-DD  short title
Tags: topic, topic
Decision: what was chosen, and by whom. Rejected options and why, when they
were live.
Why: one line.

- DEC-001 2026-10-28 — adopt moltke workflow and project rules

## DEC-001  2026-10-28  adopt moltke workflow and project rules
Tags: workflow, rules
Decision: user adopted moltke 1.2.2 with defaults for every rule: GIT commit
freely, never push; AGENTS free; PLAN one active step; DOCS README; REVIEW
fast check per step; AUDIT on demand; DEPS ask first; COMMITS per step and
plan change. TESTS gating default chosen, but no suite exists yet, so the
`none` line is recorded; completion is a claim until a suite lands and TESTS
is changed via /moltke:rules. Repo created with git init; .moltke.local.md
declined.
Why: start with conservative defaults; tighten TESTS once code exists.
